# ileaksy.github.io


Website hosted on github, main use is to redirect from ileaksy.github.io to another url used for my FiveM shop, trying to find a possibilty to re-direct to multiple sites at once, maybe discord?

Found a workour, but it would't work for users with pop-ups blocked, remade the site to look like the command promot, added buttons to open in a new tab.. Before site load it asks user to disable pop-up blocker!
